# StayBnb: The Airbnb Clone

## 📌 Overview

StayBackend is a backend system designed to power an **Airbnb-like booking platform**. It provides core functionality for **user management, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews**, with a strong emphasis on **scalability, security, and performance**.

This project  simulates a real-world production system by integrating modern tools, frameworks, and best practices.

## 🗄️ Database Design

**Entities**:

* **Users**: `id, name, email, password, role`
* **Properties**: `id, owner_id, title, description, price, location`
* **Bookings**: `id, user_id, property_id, start_date, end_date, status`
* **Payments**: `id, booking_id, amount, status, timestamp`
* **Reviews**: `id, user_id, property_id, rating, comment`

**Relationships**:

* A user can own multiple properties.
* A property can have multiple bookings.
* A booking is linked to one payment.
* A property can have multiple reviews.
